This project is a simple version of the classic Flappy Bird game. The player controls the bird and tries to navigate it through pipes to achieve the highest score.

## How to Play

- Click the left mouse button to make the bird jump.
- Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes to score points.
- If the bird collides with the pipes or hits the top/bottom of the screen, the game ends.
